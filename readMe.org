** idea
   algebra and geometry of
   the extended complex numbers and
   linear fractional transformations

   geometric objects:
   points lines triangles circles
   and their images under application of linear fractional transformations

   infinity and
   stereographic projection
   the extended complex plane
   and the Reiman sphere
   in perspective

** implementation
   represent
   complex number as a vector of two rational numbers
   [x y] or [r a]
   with the possibility of being infinity
   where 1/zero = infinity and 1/infinity = zero
   and zero/zero = infinity/infinity = undefined

   complex numbers can be added, multiplied and conjugated
   they have a length and an angle

   linear fractional transformation represented as
   a vector of four complex numbers
   [a b c d]
   that can be normalized so that
   ad - bc = 1
   has a determinant, trace, inverse
   can be composed and conjugated

   translation rotation scaling inversion
   all represented as normalized 4-vectors of complex number

   composition of transformation implemented as
   matrix multipliation of 2x2 complex matrices

   inverse of a transformation as inverse of a 2x2 matrix
   conjugation by a conjugataing map as composition
   of three matrices

** next steps
*** generalized circles
    calculate image of a
    generalized circle
    under any linear fractional transformation

    create representation of
    a generalized circle

    as a Hermitean matrix, perhaps?

*** polar and rectanglar interactive modes
    when mouse is in pre-image canvas
    draw line through mouse and origin
    and circle centered at origin through mouse point
    when in polar mode

    or verticle and horizontal lines through mouse point
    whein in rectangular mode

    also draw images of lines and circles in image canvas
*** add grandma's recipes
    add more linear fractional transformations,
    as found in Grandma's recipies

    those that
    - preserve the real line
    - preserve the unit circle, disk
    - preserve the upper half plane
    - pair circles

    - are loxodromic
    - are elliptic
    - are hyperbolic
    - are parabolic

*** allow for input of arbitrary linear fractional transformation
    allow for input of arbitrary complex number
    in polar and rectangular form
    - as [x y] -> x + iy
    - as [r a] -> r*exp(i*a)
    - as named complex numbers:
      zero one i infity w1
    - as operations on existing complex number
      minus recip conjugate
      and compositions thereof

    allow for input of linear fractional transformations

*** show properties of the transformation
    determinant
    trace
    inverse
*** allow for conjugation
    with translation, rotation, scaling
