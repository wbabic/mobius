* mobius transformations
** idea
   illuminate algebra and geometry of
   the extended complex numbers and
   linear fractional transformations

   geometric objects:
   points lines circles triangles
   and their images under application of linear fractional transformations

   transformed from user space into screen space

   two complex planes
   pre-image and image

   pencils of circles
   in pre-image canvas mapped to image canvas
   illuminate mobius transformations

   render list as a data structue
   associated with a transformation
   to be stored in a file, in a db, sent over the wire
   rendered to a canvas, instantly or animated, or to svg

   a render list contains geometry with style
   and can be transformerd
   by geometric tranformations
   and color transformations

** app behavior
   explore images of pencils of circles
   and their images under transformation

   create render lists
   of pencils with color
   rendered one at a time, or all at once
   on top of each other

   animate button will render everything in render list,
   in order added, one element at a time

   mouse mode used to create objects to be added to render list

   render list should be viewable and editable

   switching transforms shoud triger either
   an animated redraw or an instant redraw

   once a render list is created,
   one could save as an svg or
   save as data and send to server,
   or save on local file system

** implementation
*** drawing to canvas
    draw.cljs
    basic geometric primitives of
    point line triangle circle rect
    style

    rendered to a canvas context
    by sending data to a care.async channel

    a drawing-loop channel
    that renders recieved messages to a graphics context

    larger geometric objects
    constructed from a sequence of basic primitives

*** handling of events
    mouse click and move events put on events channel
    handled by an event handler
    with a control channel to start and stop

*** technologies used
    om, react
    core.match
    core.async channels
    transducers
    data representing geometric entities
    html, canvas, css
    svg (not yet implemented)
    clojurescript, cljsbuild, figwheel, brepl

** next steps
*** DONE generalized circles
    CLOSED: [2015-06-14 Sun 16:58]
    calculate image of a
    generalized circle
    under any linear fractional transformation

    create representation of
    a generalized circle
    as a Hermitian matrix

*** polar and rectanglar interactive modes
    when mouse is in pre-image canvas
    draw line through mouse and origin
    and circle centered at origin through mouse point
    when in polar mode

    or vertical and horizontal lines through mouse point
    when in rectangular mode

    lines and/or circles in pre-image canvas
    are drawn simultaneously in image canvas
    updated in both canvases as mouse moves

    lcoal state
    :mouse-mode :polar :reactangular
    :mouse-point

    events channel: mouse-move, mouse-click
    control channel: to start and stop mode
    screen->user: to convert screen space to user space

    render list - list of things to be rendered
    :axis :radial-lines :concentric-circles
    :horizontal-lines :vertical-lines

    animating-mode
    while in animating mode, temporarily disable mouse mode
    indicate visually that an animation is in place

    separate drawing data from animation
    allowing for quick redrawing while in mouse-mode

    animation button clicks add animations to the render-list
    clear removes them

*** interactive mouse modes
    modes for creating objects
    or for viewing properties

    make lines circles, triangles, quadrangles
    using mouse

    view properties such as
    orthogonal circles with two given centers
    where the third point varies along the circle
    with diameter equal to line between the two centers

    perpendicular bisectors of a line or of three lines of a triangle

    circumcircle through three points
    where two points are fixed and the third varies

    guides exist to make special objects like
    isosceles triangles
    equilateral triangles
    right triangles
    circumcircle of a triangle
    families of orthogonal circles (generalized)
    radial lines, paralell lines, concentric circles
    circles tangent to a point
    circles through two points

    the way it workd os like this:
    local state contains current mouse-mode state
    events update the state
    in mouse-mode,
    render draws the background from the app-state
    and then the current mouse state on top

    each mouse event triggers such a redraw

    events include :move :click
    :click could be a :mouse-down
    followed by a :mouse-up
    but for now, it is just a :mosue-down

    now, while animating, we want to disable mouse mode,
    this is because we are really focused on the animation
    and the drawing mode is just one on top of the previous,
    in sequence, with out redrawing - this could change,
    but for now it is the way it is

*** grandma's recipes
    add more linear fractional transformations,
    as found in Grandma's recipies

    those that
    - preserve the real line
    - preserve the unit circle, disk
    - preserve the upper half plane
    - pair circles

    - are loxodromic
    - are elliptic
    - are hyperbolic
    - are parabolic

*** allow for input of arbitrary linear fractional transformation
    and switching between a list of transforms, and adding new ones to the list

    allow for input of arbitrary complex number
    in polar and rectangular form
    - as [x y] -> x + iy
    - as [r a] -> r*exp(i*a)
    - as named complex numbers:
      zero one i infity w1
    - as operations on existing complex number
      minus recip conjugate
      and compositions thereof

    allow for input of linear fractional transformations
    by selection from a list or by entering 4 complex numbers

*** show properties of the transformation
    entries a b c d
    determinant
    trace
    inverse
    fixed points

*** allow for conjugation
    with translation, rotation, scaling
*** DONE add unit tests

    how to describe [:triangle p1 p2 p3]

    for instance
    a point is a single complex number
    a line, two complex numbers
    a triangle made up of three complex numbers,
    if not collinear, has a circumcircle - a circumcenter and a radius
    a transform can be applied to a point a line or a triangle
    and consists of complex addition and multiplication
    along with subtraction and division
    with refelction and inversion using the complex conjugate

*** get transit working
    round trip some data
*** add complex sqrt
    with tests
*** re factor draw
    into canvas specific stuff
    and mobius stuff
    add svg impementation

*** extend line segment
    line between two points
    should sometimes be extended to a whole line

    would be nice to be able to distinguish the three parts
    given two points, p1 p2,
    the three parts are
    the finite segment p1 to p2
    the infinite segments
    from infinity to p1 and
    from p2 to infinity

    and then the image of the three parts
    could also be distinguished

    as an example, consider mouse-mode, rectangular
    the vertical line consists of
    point to real axis
    and then to infinity
    and from point to infinity
    and simalarly for horizontal lines but with imaginary axis
*** three points make a circle
    the circumcircle of a triangle, if not collinear

    when the image of a line is a circle,
    the three points of the image circle are
    images of p1 p2 and infinity
    and just as the lien between two points makes three segments
    so does the image circle of a line
    that is, three corresponding arcs of a circle

    an example is under the Cayley transformation,
    in mouse-mode, polar, the line from the mouse point through the origin
    the three points are the origin, the mouse point, and infinity
    the line should have three distinctive parts
    as well as its image
    whether its image is a line or a circle

    0 1 i
    line 0 1 -> unit circle
    line 0 i -> real axis
    infinity -> one
    unit circle -> imaginary axis

    circles inside unit circle
    circles outside unit circle

    see how a line is really just a circle of infinite radius
*** express circle by three points
    as an alternative representation,
    in addition to center radius representation
    a circle can be represented by three points
    that is the circumcirlce of the triangle
    consisting of the three given points

    in case the three points are colliner,
    then the circle is really a line,
    which is a circle in the generalized sense

*** parameterized circle
    z = (at + b)/(ct + d)
    generalized equation
    z*zbar + a*z + abar*zbar + b = 0
    center = -abar
    radius = a*abar - b

    example: z = (1 + it)/(1 - it)
    z1 z0 zinfinity

    constructed and
    calibrated

    which are used throughout,
    illustrated by example
    implemented in code
    as basic data structures
