  linear fractional transformations of the extended complex plane

  lines and circles

  two complx planes
  objects and images

  stereographic projection

  perspective

** reference
   Indra's Pearls

** idea
   algebra abd geometry of
   the extended complex numbers and
   linear fractional transformations

   objects: points lines circles
   and their images
   under application of arbitrary linear fractional transformations

   infinity

   stereographic projection

** implementation
   represent
   complex number as a vector of two rational numbers
   [x y]

   linear fractional transformation as a vector of four complex numbers
   [a b c d]
   that can be normalized
   ad - bc = 1

   translation rotation scaling inversion
   as normalized 4-vectors of complex number

   infinity as inversion of zero in the unit disk

   composition of transformation as matrix multipliation of complex matrices
   conjugation by a conjugataing map as composition

   inverse of a transformation as inverse of a normalized 4-vector
